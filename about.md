Welcome, fellow traveller. You have stumbled onto my online study bible. It is based on digital gardening principles[[A garden is something inbetween a personal blog and a wiki. It's a collection of evolving notes, essays, and ideas that aren't strictly organised by their publication date. They're inherently *exploratory* â€“ posts are linked through contextual associations. They aren't refined or complete - posts can be published as half-finished thoughts that will grow and evolve over time. They're less rigid, less performative, and less perfect than the personal "blogs" we're used to encountering on the web.::rsn]]. 

This space is meant to be an exploratory space where I [[learn in public::https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/]] about Christianity and the Bible.

## About the website

### Features:

- **Page preview** (Move your mouse over the link): [[Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet]]
- **Transclusion**: Allows you to see a partial view of the contents of the website to the right or the left of the margin.
- **Sidenotes** (Changelog you see on the left is an example of this).
- **Wiki-style link:** Usually wikis allow you to specify links using double bracket, I added it here using liquid. Also added bad-link highlighting
   - Good link: [[Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet]]
   - Bad link: [[Title of a page that doesn't exist]]


Some Lesser know features:

- Go back to the blog home or to the notes page, and try to right click on any of the entry. [Hint: Zettelkasten]

- Press 'Shift + s' to trigger search

- Click this card[[Memorize me so that you do well in your exams::srs]] looking thing to know how I use my notes. [Hint: SRS]


Other Details:

- The site lives on [[Github::https://github.com/rgvr/simply-jekyll]] and is served using Netlify
- This website is statically generated using Jekyll from a set of Markdown files.
  - The Jekyll theme can be found on my Github Page, It is called "Simply-Jekyll"
- Except lunrjs and katex, there are no third party libraries. Discord is an opt-in, I don't use on my [[site::https://rgvr.me]]. I strongly believe in user privacy.
