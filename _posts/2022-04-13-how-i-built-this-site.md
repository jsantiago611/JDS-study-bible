This note [[inspired by Walter Teng's note of the same title::lsn]] contains the changelog of larger changes for building this website. I've posted them here because they may be helpful if you decide to build a similar digital garden of your own using Jekyll. 

There is also a roadmap which contains a full list of features that I plan on developing in the future.

## Roadmap 

-Add Webmentions (see [[Max Bock::https://mxb.dev/blog/webmention-analytics/]])
-Add a theme-switcher (See [[Walter Teng::https://walterteng.com/garden/theme-switcher-sg/]] or [[Max Bock::https://mxb.dev/blog/color-theme-switcher/]])
-Increase utility of metadata (see [[Gwern:https://www.gwern.net/]]. I may conpile all metadata in a sentence that reads "This is a [note/prayer/summary] about [topic]. It takes x minutes to read."
-Fix ::before behavior. Bullets and TOC not displaying properly.
-Progressive Web App (PWA) ready
-Maximize lighthouse score
-Add a sorting/filter mechanism for notes (see [[Swyx::https://www.swyx.io/ideas]]

## Version Changes

v1.1: Hello World üê£

*Released in March 2022*

-Discovered "digital gardening" (thanks [[Maggie Appleton::https://maggieappleton.com/]]!) as a way of compiling and catagorizing knowledge, and realized this was a powerful paradigm for Christians and their spiritual development. 
-After trying several templates, settled on "Simply Jekyll", due to it's plethora of features. 
-Added Dark Mode
-Added Reading time to metadata
