title: Build a study bible
---

How I'm building a digital study based on digital gardening principles. This note will hold all my stream-of-consciousness thoughts on how I should structure this digital study bible. Most of this is very unpolished, but that’s ok right?

So far, here's how I'm structuring this thing:

There are 2 types of notes:

1. **Scripture Notes**. This is the actual bible text in the NET translation. I'm using this translation because the creators believe in free distribution of the bible and don't really limit copyright. I'm a big believer in free software, and also like that I don't have to worry about copyright issues. Eventually I'll be copying in the entire biblical text, and I won't be able to do that with a copyrighted text. 
2. **My notes**. These are my own original notes, that can be further categorized as prayers, explanations, ideas, tools, etc. 

The main idea behind this digital bible is to mimic the function of a study and journaling bible, but without the space limitations of a physical bible. So, I want to be able to look at a bible text, record notes in the margins, and see links to other notes and passages. 
My main job at the moment is importing the biblical text in its entirety. 

But how will I do that? Will each book be its own note? Or will each chapter be its own note? Or perhaps I should break up the text based on ideas and outlines rather than chapters? 

Hmm. 

I guess if I want to stick to the principle of Notes should be atomic, then that should extend to the scripture notes as well. So I could just create a note for each biblical unit, instead of each chapter. I can see how this would lead to greater linkability. 

But how would that look? Maybe visualizing it will help me decide. 

Here’s a chapter division of Ecclesiastes: 

-	Note#1: Ecclesiastes 1
-	Note#2: Ecclesiastes 2

Here are the same chapters, but divided into notes based on their ideas as presented in the NET Bible: 

-	Note#1: Introduction: Utter Futility (1:1-2)
-	Note#2: Futility Illustrated from Nature (1:3-11)
-	Note#3: Futility of Secular Accomplishment (1:12-15)
-	Note#4: Futility of Secular Wisdom (1:16-18)
-	Note#5: Futility of Self-Indulgent Pleasure (2:1-3)
-	Note#6: Futility of Materialism (2:4-11)
-	Note#7: Wisdom is better than Folly (2:12-17)
-	Note#8: Futility of being a workaholic (2:18-21)
-	Note#9: Painful Days and restless nights (2:22-23)
-	Note#10: Enjoy Work and its Benefits (2:22-23)

So splitting the chapter by idea clearly seem to be the more interesting & linkable idea. I can see how this would allow me to link a chapter to another idea. The only thing I might change would be how the NET bible writes some of these headings, so that they read more like affirmations instead of themes:

-	Note#1: Utter Futility (1:1-2)
-	Note#2: Nature Illustrates Futility (1:3-11)
-	Note#3: Secular Accomplishments are Futile (1:12-15)
-	Note#4: Secular Wisdom is Futile (1:16-18)
-	Note#5: Self-Indulgent Pleasure is Futile (2:1-3)
-	Note#6: Materialism is Futile (2:4-11)
-	Note#7: Wisdom is better than Folly (2:12-17)
-	Note#8: Being a workaholic is futile (2:18-21)
-	Note#9: Futility leads to Painful Days and restless nights (2:22-23)
-	Note#10: Enjoy Work and its Benefits (2:22-23)

Now the note is usable, and can lead to further elaboration, explanation, and illustration. For example: 

-	Note#2: can contain many examples of how nature illustrates futility. So not only does the note itself act as a container for examples, these specific examples can later become notes themselves. So the Biblical text is in the note, and these other examples are there as well.
-	Note#4 Secular Wisdom is Futile can contain other notes to 1Corinthians, proverbs, and other wisdom texts. 

The notes themselves become hubs for other bible text and information. 
So. Zooming out again. How would Ecclesiastes look in a note?
Ecclesiastes
Chapter 1
-	Note#1: Utter Futility (1:1-2)
-	Note#2: Nature Illustrates Futility (1:3-11)
-	Note#3: Secular Accomplishments are Futile (1:12-15)
-	Note#4: Secular Wisdom is Futile (1:16-18)
Chapter 2
-	Note#5: Futility of Self-Indulgent Pleasure (2:1-3)
-	Note#6: Futility of Materialism (2:4-11)
-	Note#7: Wisdom is better than Folly (2:12-17)
-	Note#8: Futility of being a workaholic (2:18-21)
-	Note#9: Painful Days and restless nights (2:22-23)
-	Note#10: Enjoy Work and its Benefits (2:22-23)
So far so good. But would I have the text plus this heading? UGHHHH I’m confused. 
Ok, regrouping. 
Ok. 
So what am I trying to do? I want to have the biblical text centered on the page, and be able to link ideas. So. What I can do then is just have the entire book in it’s own note, punctuated by headers (like a paper bible does), except each header is really a link to its own note. That way, a note that originates in Exodus will always point back to the exodus note. 
Maybe note=chapter is too many divisions, and irrelevant, especially if I want to focus on the bible’s ideas. 
I’ll go try to do this with Exodus and report back here if that worked.
