title: How I Built My Website
---

This note [[inspired by Walter Teng's note of the same title::lsn]] contains the changelog of larger changes for building this website. I've posted them here because they may be helpful if you decide to build a similar digital garden of your own using Jekyll.

There is also a roadmap which contains a full list of features that I plan on developing in the future.

---

## Roadmap

- Add Webmentions (see [[Max Bock::https://mxb.dev/blog/webmention-analytics/]])
- Add a theme-switcher (See [[Walter Teng::https://walterteng.com/garden/theme-switcher-sg/]] or [[Max Bock::https://mxb.dev/blog/color-theme-switcher/]]*)
- Increase utility of metadata (see [[Gwern's Digital Garden::https://www.gwern.net/]]. I may conpile all metadata in a sentence that reads "This is a [note/prayer/summary] about [topic]. It takes x minutes to read."
- Fix ::before behavior. Bullets and TOC not displaying properly.
- Progressive Web App (PWA) ready
- Maximize lighthouse score
- Add a sorting/filter mechanism for notes (see [[Swyx::https://www.swyx.io/ideas]]
- Add a "Resonance Library"

## Version Changes

### v1.3: Sleek minimalist UI

*Released in May 2022*

- Lots of Ui changes, including font updates to Ogg for headers, Dia for Subheaders, and Ogg-Text for larger bodies of text. 

### v1.2: New UI

*Released in April 2022*

- Discovered the wonderful UI of worksinprogress.co, and decided to style the site after it.
- Header type changed to "Editor" and metadata type changed to "GT America Mono"
- Several changes made to overall borders and alignment, giving it a nice analog feel, reminiscent of those manilla colored cards in the back of old library books, a much more appropriate UI for this type of casual content.  
- ISSUE: Still deciding what to do about these bullet points. Will fix and release on the next version. Until then, bullets might be invisible.

### v1.1: Hello World üê£

*Released in March 2022*

- Discovered "digital gardening" (thanks [[Maggie Appleton::https://maggieappleton.com/]]!) as a way of compiling and catagorizing knowledge, and realized this was a powerful paradigm for Christians and their spiritual development.
- After trying several templates, settled on "Simply Jekyll", due to it's plethora of features.
- Added Dark Mode (thanks to [[Derek Kedziora's guide to adding dark mode to Jekyll sites::https://derekkedziora.com/blog/dark-mode-revisited]]
- Added Reading time to metadata (thanks to [[Carlos Becker::https://carlosbecker.com/posts/jekyll-reading-time-without-plugins/]])
