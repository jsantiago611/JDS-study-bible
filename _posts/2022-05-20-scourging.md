## Structure of this portion of John's narrative. 

This will enable us to understand John's placement at this particular place. 
John's narrative contains: 
1.arrest, 
2.trial, 
  2a. trial a  2b. scourging  2c. trial part 2. 
3.crucifiction. 

Each parts of the trial narrative has 3 scenes. So the full breakdown is:

1. Arrest
2. Trial
	Trial part 1
		scene1: 
		scene2:
		scene3:
			Scourging
	Trial part 2
		scene1: 
		scene2:
		scene3:
3. Crucifiction

Scourging is the centerpiece. 3+1+3 narrative sequence, a 7-fold holistic literary unit, symmetrically balanced around the brutal scourging. 

John is directing our attention to the pivital midpoint of his story. The centerpiece

scourging is to crucifixion  as the preliminary bout is to the main event, like a prelude to a symphony. 

- Trial Unit part 1, 3 scenes
- Scourging
- Trial Unit part 2, 3 scenes
then the crucifixion. 

This unit anticipates the climactic unit of the crux. Trial 1, curcifiction preliminary, trial 2, crux actual. 

And you don't think John is an artist? I feel sorry for you....

The scourge is the aniticipation of his completed passion narrative. It is nonetheless its own self contained unit. Clear from the shifts in camera angle, featured in 19.1 and vs 4. 

notes on the in and out camera angles

The romans also add a coronation. 
A vicsious display of torture. 

## Description of scourging:

1. Persons being crucified had a status beneath a beast, less than an animal, abused like animals. was a nonperson, not a humna, a piece of meat to be beat, flayed. criminals, sociaty scum, slaves were crux. 

was degredation, brute humiliation, dead meat, a thing, not a human. 

2. Scourging inflicted torture on victim by flogging. intended to weaken victim by beating his body into state of shock. traumatizing flesh. destroying integrity o f physiological processes-- to collapse. whipping so that crux would not be necessary. it guar a faster more immediate death once nails driven in. 

this is not mere whipping witha  few lashes. cat of 9 tails, fortified with embedded razor sharp fragments of metal and bone, lashed on the back, cutting and slicing and tearing body into a pulp, a bleeding, hemmoraging mass of mush. if not dead now, loss of blood enoughto be weak and disoriented enough. 

part of reason for this torture was conviction that if the scourges cut deep enough, it would beat out the victiim's guilt. wanted to expose guilt and shame, bu also a sign of ownership. to whip the flesh was to dominate the flesh. part of a viscious power trip. a symbol of raw, violent, abusive control. "we control you" SLASH SLASH

A detail to be observed: 
Normal custom placed scourging after sentencing. An exclamation point on the uguilty verdict. 
Pilote has not yet sentenced JEsus, but orders to proceed. on 2 occassions as goes to the jews, that Jesus is not guilty. We must ask... why does pIlote have him scourged if he pronounces him innocent?
Recall 18.28-40...Pilote gambles that he can release... he tells jews to deal with Him themselves, but they throw it back. THEN, he talks about other kingdom, and rolls the dice again in an effort to relesase Jesus, but they pick Barabbas a real criminal. Pilote, outdone 2x, he rolls the dice agin, scourging JEsus. the ultimate gamble is to make Jesus central character to reducing religious fanatic to a buffoon, clown. He is hoping that the jews will take pity on the "cartoon king", pathetic pitiful jesus. a bloody mess so they will feel sorry for him. 

in this coronation scquestn, he is crowned w/thorns. not rose thorns, but long spiny thorns rammed down to the bone of the skull. Robed in puple, a patheitc characature of royalty, soluted. 

they beat and stike him on the face, insult, 

pilote delivers last trump card (#3), this parody of a king...such a king could surely evoke pity and clemancy. 

BUT! Pilote miscalculated once more... only incites the bloodlust of the crowd, like a feeding frenzy. 

John's centerpiece here is Christ's glorious humiliation. 
The cursed tree become the glorious throne 

It is not an object of pity that our Lord 
it is the object 

We do not wish to dwell on the horror of what he endured, as if that horror is an object in itself, we wish to understadn the horror he endured as the glory of his exaltation. 
Let us be bound more closely to this precious bloeeding saviour, who as one has covered our blame and guilt so freely and willingly. Let us be bound so freely that we may understand that his sufferings \let us be bound to the scourging of your dear son that we may underst the depth and horror of our sin and bless him...
