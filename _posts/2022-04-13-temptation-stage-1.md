[[**Epistemic status:** This is my reflection on Tim Keller's April 11th Devotional in "God's Wisdom for Navigating life" where he discusses Proverbs 7:14.::wrap]]

>â€œI had to offer sacrifices, and today I have paid my vows; so now I have come out to meet you, to seek you eagerly, and I have found you." (Proverbs 7:14-15, ESV)

The first step in tempation pretty much goes like this:

1. man: "I'm a pretty good person that doesn't typically mingle in things like affairs. I am also married, and good husbands don't go and get affairs."
2. also man: "here's an opportunity to have an affair. If I go through with this, I turn from a good husband to a bad husband to...maybe not a husband anymore"
3. Also man: "But in this particular case, that way of thinking doesn't apply. Becuase [insert whatever excuse here, i.e. "she's been treating me poorly, I'm overworked and my wife is not stepping up to the plate, and so on. "]
4. finally: "Since I found a [sort of] logical way to be a good person while doing a bad thing, I guess I can do it?

(In the proverb, the woman manages to justify what she is about to do by rationalizing that she has "already paid her vows, offered sacrifices". Done what good people do.)

Sure, it's oversimplified. But this observation [that the 1st stage of temptation is rationationalization] is significant because it helps me understand that:

- **Temptation is not a magical event.** It doesn't "just happen", as if one trips over it. It exists within a progression, which, if caught early on, may be avoided or staved off. 
- **Temptation begins as a mental phenomenon.** It's genesis occurs in the mind. It stems from a mental seed which, if left unattended, will swallow up the garden of the mind like a weed. 
- **Tempataion leads to morally wrong places.** If something were morally right, *would I really have to rationalize it?* 

It's common knowledge in the marketing world that people buy things because of hte emotions attached to said "thing". And we often need facts and figures to justify illogical purchases. Tempatation does something similar. in the process of templation, We have to be convinced that what we are about to do fits with our "self-image of still-being-good-people." (Tim Keller)

At a macro-level in the west, I think we've perfected this rationalization. Non-profits and individuals have found explanations for Abortion that have created a way of murdering someone without being called a murderer. Worst, it is sold as a way of respecting one's body. 

### Implications of this discovery:

1. **Rationalization of sin is dangerous** because it becomes difficult to discern whom I can trust. When companies mingle good social justice causes with immoral company practices, the line between good and and bad becomes a gradient. So, be wise and look out for anyone trying to reconcile sin with a "self-image of still-being-good-people." Burn the bridge. 
2. **This data gives me an escape route.** If I can catch my rationalization "in the act" , so to speak, the temptation may be diverted and life will continue without disaster. But if not, it appears that the rationalization continues to the next stage. [[The second stage of temptation is Overpromise]].
