[[Epistemic Status: I started thinking about this yesterday, but need to flesh out these stages and include better examples as they come up. My response below feels generic.::wrap]]

After the mental shift ([[the First stage of temptation is rationalization]]), we believe an overpromise. 

Keller says that *"the woman says, literally, 'I looked for you only' (verse 15), meaning 'you are the one I've been looking for all my life."* And so a fleeting sexual encounter is framed as a cosmic life-fulfilling event that promises to leave this man better than he was before. 

### Have I seen this second stage of temptation play out in any area of my life?

I've noticed that these overpromises are usually subtle, and not as blatant as I'll write out below. 

- The overpromise of anger: *"Venting your unrighteous anger to your children will make you feel better. And they'll respect you more." 
- The overpromise of pride: *"Chasing a bigger paycheck will make you life more meaningful. You'll be a better father, more respectable husband. Even if it comes as the expense of family time. 
- The overpromise of greed: *"Daydreaming about your friend's nicer house and better job will make you feel better. After all, you deserve that too."

At this point, the temptation has become harder to shake off. Before getting to this point of believing a promise, I think it's much easier to identify and stop the temptation at stage 1. If not, the next stage ([[the third stage of temptation is the tittilation of senses]]) is practically impossible to shake.
