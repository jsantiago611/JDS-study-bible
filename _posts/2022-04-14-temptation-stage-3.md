It's interesting how the arousal of the sense comes last. When I often think of temptation, I usually place this stage first and overlook the mental processes ([[The first stage of temptation is rationalization]]) and heart changes ([[The second stage of temptation is overpromise]]) that take place just prior to this. 

### I think this is the overall process of [[Temptation]] as I see it right now: 

See/hear/think/smell/feel something that triggers an invitation to sin
↓
Reconcile the sin with my image of being a "good person"
↓
Believe the overpromise that doing this will make me feel better
↓
See/hear/think/smell/feel something that makes the promise real
↓
Sin
↓
Experience the actual consequences of sin, contra the overpromise that was believed

### Reflection
This third stage of temptation has played out very tangibly in my life and is easilest to see, but the earlier stages are not as evident. By the time I see this stage, the part I can "feel", I've noticed that both myself and others are already so deep in the temptation that it's too hard to pull out.

So if I should be skilled in stopping temptation from alluring me to full-blown sin, I need to be skilled in identifying the first stage, because when I am "feeling/seeing/so on" it's often too late.
