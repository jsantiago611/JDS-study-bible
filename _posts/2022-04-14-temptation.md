## What is temptation? 

I like [[this definition::https:newbreak.church/study-guide-fighting-temptation/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=study-guide-fighting-temptation]]:

>What is temptation? It is anything that promises satisfaction at the expense of our relationships, and especially our relationship with God. Temptation says: you're going to like this... This is going to make you feel better... This will make your life more meaningful. 

## The anatomy of temptation
1. [[The first stage of temptation is rationalization]]
2. [[The second stage of temptation is overpromise]]
3. [[The third stage of temptation is the titillation of the senses]]
4. [[the fourth stage of temptation is the reassurance that there will be no real consequences]]

[[Defend yourself against temptation]]
