**Intended audience:** Christians who want to read the Psalms to enrich and inform their own prayers. [["Praying with the Psalms" by Timothy Keller::rsn]] 

**Epistemic status:** Pretty settled on this structure. Spent months and months reading through books and material before settling on this workflow.

I agree with Tim Keller when he says, 

>"It will be much easier to pray a psalm after you’ve first studied it. If you don’t understand it, you will find it hard to meditate or pray it."

Heres a pathway that I'm recording to remember but also to share with all who want to progress from study to meditation to prayer. Major portions of this are taken directly from Praying with the Psalms:

### The Framework I'm using to study+pray through the psalms

1. **Read:** Read the psalm at least 3 times, slowly.
2. **Theme:** Decide on a theme and paraphrase it in a single phrase or sentence.
3. **Outline:** (still working on this step)
4. **Title & Theme revision:** Optional: Read through a reliable commentary and reconsider your outline. Give it a title and revise the theme after study
5. **With Christ:** Write down how to pray this psalm in light of Christ, seeing Christ praying it and/or praying it to him.
6. **Meditate on it:** Write meditation thoughts:
...1. Adore: What does this psalm show me about God for which I should praise or thank Him?
...2. Admit: What does the psalm show me about my sin that I should confess and repent of? What false attitudes, behaviour, emotions, or idols come alive in me whenever I forget this truth?
...3. Aspire: What does the text show me about a need that I have? What do I need to do or become in light of this? How shall I petition God for it? What did I learn about life that I could aspire to, ask for, or act on? [[Adapted from "The Songs of Jesus" and "Prayer", both titles by Tim Keller.::lsn]]
7. **Praying it:** Actually pray, using your meditation thoughts from step 6 as an "on-ramp."
